# Working along with a book

This is my work done by following a book from the packt collection.
The book: C++ high Performance 2nd edition.
TODO: Add links

## Specs used

The work has been done on mac OS and the compiler was clang from llvm.
Some tests will be done to see if gcc is working fine as well.

## Dependencies

We need google benchmark, google gtest and boost.
I mainly worked by having them locally.

- brew install google-benchmark
- brew install googletest
- brew install boost
